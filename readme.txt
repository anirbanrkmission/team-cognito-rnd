This ipynb file is detecting spam and ham newses.

1. It's splitting the data into train-test by train_test_split.
2. Then it is vectorized using term frequency * inverse document frequency vectorizer.
3. Then the splitted data is fitted on the vectorizer.
4. Passive aggressive classifier is choosen from sklearn.linear_model to detect spam.
5. Then the score is generated by accuracy_score method.
6. Accuracy and confusion matrix is given to justify the classification.
